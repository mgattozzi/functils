# How do I contribute?
There's a whole bunch of issues in the tracker! If it's open feel free
to start working on it. If you need clarification on the issue leave
a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. I can help
mentor the issue if you need it and if not fork and just implement it.
Each issue is really just a single function that needs to get
implemented so they're all bite sized and easy to implement.

Each issue includes (for now) the Haskell Version of how to implement
it and an example of the expected output. If you don't know Haskell
don't worry! Just ask and it will be explained.

There are no stupid questions and the more help the better!
